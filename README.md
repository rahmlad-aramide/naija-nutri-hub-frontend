# **Hacktoberfest Open Source Challenge 3.0**

Welcome to the Hacktoberfest Open Source Challenge 3.0 organized by the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors Community in collaboration with the GitHub Campus Experts, Unilag Community! We're thrilled to have you on board for this exciting journey of collaboration and open-source contributions.

## **About the Challenge**

This year the Hacktoberfest ML/AI Open-Source Challenge focuses on **one flagship project — Naija Nutri Hub**.

**Naija Nutri Hub** is an end-to-end, AI-powered food platform focused on **Nigerian food**. The goal is a practical, production-ready tool that combines computer vision, nutrition knowledge, recipe generation, and local discovery into a single experience. Participants can contribute across ML/AI engineering, frontend, backend, UI/UX design, DevOps, and non-technical roles (docs, community, testing).

### Project overview
Naija Nutri Hub allows a user to take or upload a photo of a meal and receive:
- **Food classification** — Identify the dish (single or multiple items in an image).  
- **Nutritional & calorie estimates** — Grounded nutrition facts pulled or reconciled from external APIs/databases.  
- **Recipe suggestions** — Step-by-step cooking recipes (and ingredient/portion guidance) generated or retrieved for the identified dish.  
- **Nearby restaurants** — Recommend local restaurants that sell the same or similar dishes.
